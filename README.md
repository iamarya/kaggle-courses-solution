# Kaggle Course Solution

Kaggle courses are one of the best places if anybody wants to learn and apply quickly python and machine learning skills. What I mean is, for deep knowledge you have to definitely explore more, but this a good place to start. These micro-courses are the single fastest way to gain the skills you'll need to do independent data science projects.
